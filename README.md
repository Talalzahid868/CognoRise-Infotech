# CognoRise-Infotech
# Python Mini Projects
This repository contains three beginner-level Python projects created as part of my internship at CognoRise InfoTech. Each project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts and offers a fun way to interact with Python.

Projects Overview
1. Simple Calculator
A basic calculator that performs fundamental arithmetic operations:

Features: Addition, subtraction, multiplication,division and modulus.
Technologies Used: Python conditionals and basic arithmetic logic.
2. Hangman Game
An interactive word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time.

Features: Random word selection, tracking guessed letters, and limited attempts.
Technologies Used: Python loops, conditionals, and list handling.
3. Rock, Paper, Scissors
A command-line game of rock-paper-scissors where the user competes against the computer.

Features: User input, random computer moves, and winner determination based on game rules.
Technologies Used: Python conditionals,functions and random module.
